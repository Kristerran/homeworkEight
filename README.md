# README Generator, Homework Eight.

## Link to deployed project:
Site not deployed, for use in terminal.
## Description
-README Generator is my eighth project for UC Davis' Web dev bootcamp. THe program takes in a series of user prompts through the terminal and generates a README.md file in the project repo.

### Project Motivation:
- I took inspiration from other similar projects and read on what makes a good README File. I was motivated by my past critiques by perrs of unfinished README Files and will continue to refine and use this program to create basic README Files.

### Project Problem solved:
- This project solves the problem of time wastage. When creating a simple project, this program helps flesh out a README file so you can focus on other parts of programming.

### Skills Learned during project:
- I learned a lot about Node.js, Inquire and other Modules. I also have continued to refine my coding process. I also took a decent amount of time during this project to explore README structure, basic markdown language, and other Developers README files. This has helped me learn to create interesting and informative README Files.

## Installation
The required files will need to be downloaded including the node-modules folder included in the repo and Node.JS. From there you will initialize the folder in your terminal, and type node index.js. From there you will be prompted to answer the included questions. Be as detailed as you can, as these will be your completed README file.

## Usage
- This project is used to create descriptive and interesting README files. It is a time saving application that makes your coding time easier and helps form a structural basis for future additions to your README file

## Tests
Create a simple README file. See how the file changes based on your input!
